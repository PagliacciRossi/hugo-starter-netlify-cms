*Classe operaia* was a journal, published between 1964 and 1967, that was heavily associated with operaismo.\
\
In the caption of each piece is a translation of any text contained within them, as well as any other necessary basic information. Enjoy!\

> “*Marrioti’s workers were not the Communist Party workers, that part of humankind that would have ‘saved the world.’ Marrioti’s figures did not stand for an antithesis in a dialectical political process, but rather a total negation. His class refused the values of culture, peace, humanity, and did so with a smile on their face.*” – Galimberti

*‘Monument to the Unknown Capitalist’*

*‘Goodnight, Mr Boss’*As Galimberti emphasises, the worker’s crested helmet reminds us of the depiction of the ‘unknown capitalist’, the venerated ‘knights of labour’, sardonically depicted above.\
“The worker has taken the plumed helm directly from the businessman’s hands, and in the night he sports it as a battle-trophy.”
