***We here want to stress that a workers’ inquiry is not just about getting the most accurate image of capitalist society – a society that is so profoundly contradictory and ever-changing that we might never hope to gain a true image of it – but is a practice which is, ultimately, political.***

The below is the script for our video  [‘A Moment With Marx | Introduction to Workers’ Inquiry #1′](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfHWS9zbbek)"

> *"The militant is always looking for something that they don’t yet understand, a possible force to make the contradictions explode, something that already exists but that they can’t yet see. The militant is either restless or they are not a militant." -* Gigi Roggero [in Viewpoint Magazine](https://viewpointmag.com/2020/04/30/a-science-of-destruction-an-interview-with-gigi-roggero-on-the-actuality-of-operaismo/).

Workers’ inquiry is a method of investigation into the labour process from the point of view of the Worker. That is, it proceeds from workers’ own direct experiences, and is not an attempt to understand the workplace from the outside. 

While sociological analyses of the workplace have long been undertaken by bosses, managers and nosy academics – producing what we might call a specialist knowledge ‘from above’ – workers’ inquiries are instead a tool for producing a knowledge ‘from below’ which takes workers’ own experiences as the lense through which to understand the labour process. 

By considering the dynamics of work from such a perspective, militant investigators believe this can yield a more positive, accurate and complete knowledge of work in general, and especially of the specific nature of work under capitalist production and exploitation. Crucially, inquiries also illuminate workers’ organisational power that exist in a workplace at any given time. 

Workers’ inquiry developed as a significant method of political organisation throughout the 20th century. Inspired by an original questionnaire composed by the german Economic and Political theorist Karl Marx in the late 19th century, groups such as the Johnson-Forrest Tendency in America, and the militants of Quaderni Rossi in Italy, would go on to develop and shape this mode of investigation. Ultimately pioneering new currents of Marxist thought, the popular movements of Operaismo/Workerism and class composition theory, for example, develop from insights into the labour process gained through conducting inquiries.

The central aim of this video series is therefore to offer a concise and comprehensive introduction to these theories and movements, and to articulate what political lessons we might draw from these struggles today. We also aim to explore contemporary examples of workers’ inquiries, including innovations within the practice which enable it to become a broader tool for social analysis. We will of course also reflect on some of the limits and failings of workers’ inquiry, and by doing so establish that its still a live, current and ever-evolving weapon in workers’ struggles. 

Our starting point for these discussions lies with Karl Marx, and the original attempt to compose a workers’ inquiry in 1880. First, we will briefly describe the context in which Marx conducted his research, and how this later attempt at a workers’ inquiry shows a development from his earlier analyses of capitalist society. 

Marx in Das Kapital

In the decades before Marx produced his workers’ inquiry, he offered a vivid, puncturing, and often brutal, account of the nature of capitalist society – culminating  in his most famous work Das Kapital. Developing from but primarily arguing Against the understanding of Capitalism put forward by the bourgeois political economists of his era, like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, Marx revealed beneath the categories used to understand capitalist society, lies not only its hidden violence but also the struggles of the workers. 

For example, in Chapter 15 of Capital, Machinery and Large-Scale Industry, Marx discusses  the economic transformations resulting from the introduction of machinery into British industry, and offers a framework for understanding the changes in value-production this entailed. But Marx also provides startling insights into the underlying social reality of this new industrial epoch in Britain through presenting the findings of British Factory Inspectors. These commissions were appointed by the British government throughout the 19th century to investigate living and working conditions in different sectors of industry, in response to the increasingly militant and oppositional movements of British workers. Their reports detailed horrendous realities endured by workers, of the declining life expectancies, and harsh working conditions. In one such example, Marx emphasises through the conclusions of the factory inspectors themselves, the conflicting demands between workers’ need for clean air in confined spaces and capital’s drive to maximise productivity:  

‘The health officers, the industrial inquiry commissioners, the factory inspectors, all repeat, over and over again, that it is both necessary for the workers to have these 500 cubic feet, and impossible to impose this rule on capital. They are, in reality, declaring that consumption and the other pulmonary diseases of the workers are conditions necessary to the existence of capital.’

Yet Marx also stated that beneath these continual attempts of the capitalist class to maximise profit-extraction and surplus-theft through the alteration of the working day and further immiseration of the workers, there lies the positive struggle waged by these very workers against capitalism. Marx tells us that **‘The creation of a normal working day is therefore a product of a protracted civil war, more or less dissembled, between the capitalist class and the working-class’**. (\*Cleaver quote) This perspective establishes that workers are not merely an exploited object of capitalism but constitute a dynamic and active force in society which capitalists constantly have to guard against.  (\*) As Marx himself says  **‘It would be possible to write a whole history of the inventions made since 1830 for the sole purpose of providing capital with weapons against working class revolt.’** 

As we’ve shown, Das Kapital illustrates both the realities of capitalist society in 19th century Britain, as well as the political power of the workers – after all Marx felt Das Kapital was a weapon to be put in the hands of the workers – yet, there is what some have called a ‘silence in Das Kapital’; the missing perspective of the workers themselves. Much of Das Kapital is constituted by what we might call Bourgeois Inquiries into the labour process and living conditions of the working class; they inform us of empirical realities about the working class, but they fail to, and possibly even *cannot*, address these issues from a workers’ perspective. There is an insurmountable social distance between an observer, sympahtetic or otherwise, and the lived experience and possible knowledge of the workers themselves (*).

While the reports of factory inspectors were often utilised for the benefit of the working class, they were not a direct expression of workers’ power, and could in fact often be politically dangerous; as Marx documents, workers often withheld from contacting inspectors, as to do so might risk them ‘sacrificing themselves’ and losing their jobs. What is therefore necessary is a form of inquiry which is not reliant on the goodwill of the inspector, but built on the knowledge of the worker. 

The Inquiry

So, In order to gain a more accurate knowledge of how workers organised their resistance to capitalism in the workplace and in the wider social environment, and to understand better what knowledge of the economic system workers themselves possessed and developed, Marx created the first workers’ inquiry. 

Appearing in 1880 in the French newspaper La Revue, this first attempt at a workers’ inquiry perhaps reflects the transformations of Marx’s political activities and theoretical views that had occurred in the 1870s. Through both his engagement with the ultimately fatal revolutionary struggle of the 1871 Paris commune and through his analysis of the global spread of capitalism, Marx’s thought had become increasingly sensitive toward the realities of working class struggle in the world around him. the inquiry took the form of a large survey of 101 questions regarding workers’ social and productive realities, alongside their political activities. In this document he states

“We hope to meet in this work with the support of all workers in town and country who understand that they alone can describe with full knowledge the misfortunes from which they suffer and that only they, and not saviour sent by providence, can energetically apply the healing remedies for the social ills which they are prey. We also rely upon socialists of all schools who, being wishful for social reform, must wish for an *exact* and *positive* knowledge of the conditions in which the working class – the class to whom the future belongs – works and moves.” 

Ultimately, there are no known responses to this survey. Although this might lead some to consider the inquiry a failure, as we will show in subsequent discussions, Marx’s original workers’ inquiry, and the shift in understanding it entailed, would go on to inform many cycles of significant political activity  – based on variations of this method. 

Presented here are some of the most significant tenets of workers’ inquiry established by Marx. These can be outlined as follows:

1.      That workers, by engaging in a particular form of activity, have access to a particular perspective from which the dynamics of capitalist exploitation might be more accurately rendered. 

In other words, by occupying a specific space in the system of wage-labour, workers can know its realities more authentically and directly. 

For example, Marx inquires about hygienic conditions, safety measures, and the general experience of work itself, “not only the technical side, but the muscular and nervous strain required, and its general effect on the health of the workers.” 

Expressed by workers themselves, the inquiry therefore has the potential to move beyond a partial knowledge of work, as represented by sympathetic factory inspectors, to a total knowledge enabled primarily by the experience of work. 

2.      By considering the social situation of the workers, a more complete understanding of the working class and its movements might be gained.

 For example, Marx wanted to know about the varying societies which support workers through sickness or incapacity. He also asks: Have there been cases of the state using ‘armed forces’ against workers on behalf of employers? How much time is lost in coming to the workshop and returning home? 

Similarly, he recognised the importance of thinking about divisions in labour, be they gendered or generational, and how this shapes a workplace and the exploitation within it. 

3.    Finally, being  Geared towards political organising, workers’ inquiry is a mode of political activity, and not just a form of research. Marx had hoped these survey results would be circulated as a tool for struggle, communication and organisation between the international proletariat. For example, Marx asks 

82. Do any resistance associations exist in your trade, and how are they led? 

83. How many strikes have taken place in your trade that you are aware of?

84. How long did these strikes last?

87. What were their results?

89. Were strikes in your trade ever supported by strikes of workers belonging to other trades?

What this inquiry demonstrates is no less than a great epistemological shift from considering as gospel the reports of intellectual observers, to considering as more accurate, more positive, and more complete, the actual knowledge and experience of workers themselves. Systematised into a complete study, the multiplicity of experiences, thoughts and activities of workers has the potential to reveal in greater clarity the realities of capitalist society beyond the illusions of conventional wisdom. 

We here want to stress that a workers’ inquiry is not just about getting the most accurate image of capitalist society – a society that is so profoundly contradictory and ever-changing that we might never hope to gain a true image of it – but is a practice which is, ultimately, political. 

In later videos in this series, we will aim to demonstrate how this original inquiry and its approach has come to be reshaped and reworked, and thus to think about its inherent limitations – for example, while Marx was inquiring into the direct reality of the workers, unlike the aforementioned factory inspectors, it was he, not the workers, who determined which questions should be asked and thus what information might be deemed relevant.
